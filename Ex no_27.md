# EX 27 C program that demonstrates the use of typedef to create a new alias name for a data type.

## AIM:

To write a C program that demonstrates the use of typedef to create a new alias name for a data type.

## Algorithm

Start.

Declare a variable value of type char.

Prompt the user to enter a value.

Read the value using scanf.

#include <stdio.h>

typedef int MyInt;

int main() {

 MyInt num = 10;
 
 printf("The value of num is: %d\n", num);
 
 return 0;
